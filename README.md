# Demo 3

For this demo we take a close look at classes. 
* We talk about public variables, which are declared in python with the prefix `self.` 
* We also note the dunder or double underscore method `def __init__` . 
* We note that with a class we build it and then we have to instantiate it. 
* Finally we note that a class need not return any value, but it can, and that you can call any function within a class after instantiating it, so long as you give the proper parameters.
